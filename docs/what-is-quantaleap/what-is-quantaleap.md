As DevOps engineers, we understand how hard it can be to maintain cloud infrastructures. Cloud computing changed the pace of software releases and technology adoption. We're stuck between monitoring logs, incident management systems and workflows that never run in sync. In search of efficiency, companies turn to serverless/event-driven platforms to glue IT operations together. While automation helps us handle planned and repetitive tasks, the incidents that end up costing us the most are the ones that are unexpected: downtime, cybersecurity risks and underutilized resources. We need automation to decide for us when incidents need to be solved and how. Quantaleap bridges this gap.
