As DevOps engineers, we understand how hard it can be to maintain cloud infrastructures. Cloud computing changed the pace of software releases and technology adoption. We're stuck between monitoring logs, incident management systems and workflows that never run in sync. In search of efficiency, developers & SRE teams turn to serverless platforms to glue IT operations together. While automation helps us handle planned and repetitive tasks, the incidents that end up costing us the most are the ones that are unexpected: downtime, cybersecurity risks, over- and underutilized resources. We need a new, intelligent kind of automation to help us decide when incidents need to be solved and how. Quantaleap extends serverless computing with decision making capabilities to run async workflows at critical times.
